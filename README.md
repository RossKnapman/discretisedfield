## About

This module is a Python package that provides:

- Creating finite difference meshes

- Creating and analysis of finite difference fields

- Plotting of finite difference field

- Reading and writing of different files, such as `.ovf` and `.vtk`

- Available on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

- Available for Python 3.5+

## Installation and upgrade

This module (`discretisedfield`) can be installed using either `pip` or `conda` package managers.

### Requirements

Before running installing `discretisedfield` via `pip`, please make sure you have Python 3.5+ on your system. You can check that by running

    python3 --version

If you are using Linux, you probably already have Python installed. However, on MacOS and Windows, this is usually not the case. If you do not have Python 3.5+ on your machine, we stronly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution. Firstly, [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) Anaconda for your operating system and then follow instructions on the download page. Further information about installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).

When you install Python using Anaconda distribution on MacOS or Windows, you will also install `pip`. However, on Linux, if you do not have it installed, you can get it with

    sudo apt install python3-pip

### `pip`

To install the `discretisedfield` version currently in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) - the Python Package Index repository, run in your terminal

    python3 -m pip install discretisedfield

If you already have the package installed, you can upgrade it by running

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade discretisedfield

On the other had, if you want to use the most recent version of `discretisedfield` which is still under development, you can do it with

    git clone https://github.com/joommf/discretisedfield
    cd discretisedfield
    python3 -m pip install .

Note: If you do not have `git` on your system, please follow instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
