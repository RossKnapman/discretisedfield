## About

`discretisedfield` is a Python package that provides:

- Creating finite difference meshes

- Creating, analysis, and plotting of finite difference fields

- Reading and writing of different file types, such as `.ovf` and `.vtk`

- Available on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

- Requires Python 3.5+

## Installation

`discretisedfield` can be installed using either `pip` or `conda` package managers.

### Python requirements

Before installing `discretisedfield` via `pip`, please make sure you have Python 3.5+ on your system. You can check that by running

    python3 --version

If you are using Linux, most probably you already have Python. However, on MacOS and Windows, this is usually not the case. If you do not have Python 3.5+ on your machine, we strongly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your operating system and follow instructions on the download page. Further information about installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).

### `pip`

After installing Anaconda on MacOS or Windows, `pip` will also be installed. However, on Linux, if you do not have `pip`, you can install it with

    sudo apt install python3-pip

To install the `discretisedfield` version currently in the Python Package Index repository [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) run

    python3 -m pip install discretisedfield

#### Updating

`discretisedfield` can be updated to the latest released version by running

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade discretisedfield

However, if you want to use the most recent version of `discretisedfield` (still under development), you can do it by running

    git clone https://github.com/joommf/discretisedfield
    python3 -m pip install discretisedfield

**Note**: If you do not have `git` on your system, it can be installed by following these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
